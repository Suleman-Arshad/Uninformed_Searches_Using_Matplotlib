Grid Pathfinding Visualizer (Uninformed Search Edition)This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that visualize classic Uninformed Search algorithms on an 8x8 grid. Each script demonstrates how different data structures (Queues, Stacks, Priority Queues) and constraints affect pathfinding behavior and efficiency.
🚀 Algorithms IncludedBreadth-First Search (BFS): Finds the shortest path in unweighted grids using a FIFO queue.Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as deep as possible; demonstrates "best-case" and "worst-case" scenarios based on node ordering.Uniform Cost Search (UCS): Finds the mathematically optimal path by accounting for step weights (e.g., Diagonals costing $1.41$).Depth-Limited Search (DLS): A DFS variant that prevents infinite loops by setting a maximum depth boundary.Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS): Combines the memory efficiency of DFS with the optimality of BFS.Bidirectional Search: Runs two simultaneous searches from Start and Target to meet in the middle, significantly reducing search space.
🛠️ Installation & DependenciesEnsure you have Python 3.x installed. The project relies on Matplotlib for the interactive visualization.Install Matplotlib:Bashpip install matplotlib
⚙️ Movement ConstraintsAll algorithms in this project follow a Strict Clockwise Movement Order (including only the Main Diagonal):Up (-1, 0) Right (0, 1) Bottom (1, 0) Bottom-Right  (1, 1) — Main DiagonalLeft (0, -1) Top-Left $(-1, -1)$ — Main DiagonalNote: Top-Right and Bottom-Left diagonals are excluded per project requirements.💻 How to RunExecute any algorithm script using Python:Bashpython bidirectional_search.py

Increase the number to slow down the animation or decrease it for faster results.Adjust Depth Limit: In the DLS or IDDFS scripts, you can modify the LIMIT variable to see how it affects the success of the search.
